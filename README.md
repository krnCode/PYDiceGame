# A Game of Dice

## Description

This is a small python game I'm making. It's a text-based adventure.

The idea came when I was searching for small python projects for beginners to step up my python skills, and since the simple dice game project was just meant to print random numbers like rolling a dice, I thought about challenging myself in creating this.

So the main idea is pretty simple: make a little text-based adventure with a tiny story, and building it up with more elements until I'm satisfied with the end product.

Of course, the focus is not to turn this in a AAA game and win awards, but a little thing to make me better at python (somehow).

## The game

Still in the 'alpha' phase, but it'll play like this:

You're a dude that has some luck in games of dice, and will play against other dudes in games of dice.

While you'll play the game, you'll know more about the history (pretty cheesy, so don't bother about that).

I'll make some gameplay elements like upgrades, life, NPC dialogs, skills, menus, save system, etc. (also, think about a better name for it).

## Expected release date

Soonâ„¢

But really, this is a side project, and as I have work, chores and other things to do, don't expect a release date on this.

As I'll progress through the project, I'll add the changes in the top of this README, like a changelog.

## Project Plan

I made a little project planning so it can help me to make things from beginning to end. You can check this out here: [A Game of Dice](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sUxKhpr9DKwoasaZ217a5a1cPq6y4grl)

## Closing

As always, I appreciate constructive feedback. Thanks in advance!
